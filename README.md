## 1. About the Project

This project serves as the API implementation for Schedule Pro, a modern appointment and scheduling management system designed to streamline operations for service-based businesses.

Built with NestJS, Node.js, TypeScript, Prisma, SendGrid, and Twilio, the Schedule Pro API provides a secure and scalable backend for managing users, sessions, and appointments.

The API includes robust authentication with JWT, role-based access control (RBAC), secure session management, and integrates external services like SendGrid for transactional emails and Twilio for OTP-based verification. This architecture ensures a reliable communication flow, secure user authentication, and efficient permission management across the platform.

## 4. Installation
### Prerequisites:
Before running the project, ensure that **Node.js** is installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version recommended).

To verify your Node.js installation, run:

```console
node -v
npm -v
```

Clone the repository to your local machine

```console
git clone https://github.com/kaikyMoura/Schedule-Pro-API.git
```

Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd Schedule-Pro-AP
```
Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## 6.  Environment Setup

### Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root based on the example below:

```env
# You can ask chatgpt if you don't know how to generate
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_here

# PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db_schedulepro"

# SendGrid
SENDGRID_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here

```

### PostgreSQL Database
You need a PostgreSQL database to run the project. You can create one in several ways:
- Install postgres sql locally: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Using `create db` [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createdb.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createdb.html)
- Or via Docker + postgres [https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

### Prisma Setup
After configuring your database and .env, initialize and generate the Prisma client:

```console
# Run the Prisma migration via pnpm
pnpm prisma migrate deploy

# Generate the Prisma client
pnpm prisma generate
```

You can use the Prisma CLI to inspect your DB or update schema as needed:

```console
pnpm prisma studio   # Open GUI to manage the DB
```

---

## 7. Running the Application:
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:

```console
npm start:dev
# or
pnpm start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
```

the application will be available on:

```console
http://localhost:5000
```
